Astronomical observations of stars only capture the properties of the surface. The inside remains hidden. But with the help of physics and our understanding of element fusion, we can piece together what's going on. Learn how the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is a reflection of the processes that occur in the center of stars. This is a different take on element production, namely how it influences the surface properties throughout the stars' lifetime from birth to supernova explosion.
